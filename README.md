 Quiz Project in C++: Test Your Knowledge! 

As a beginner in programming, I developed a simple yet engaging quiz application using C++. This project was a great opportunity for me to enhance my understanding of fundamental concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and user input handling.

Project Overview:
Features: The quiz consists of 5 easy-level general knowledge questions.
Scoring: Each correct answer earns the user 10 points; incorrect answers score zero.
Passing Criterion: To pass, participants need a minimum score of 30 out of 50.
User Experience: Users are greeted with instructions and prompted to answer each question. At the end, their score and quiz outcome are displayed.

Technical Details:
Language Used: C++
Functions: Modularized the quiz using functions for displaying instructions and each quiz question.
User Input Handling: Utilized cin for user answers and conditional statements (if) to evaluate correctness.
Output: Employed cout for interactive messaging and displaying the scorecard.

Learning Outcomes:
Problem-solving: Managed user input validation and scoring logic.
Code organization: Practiced code structuring and modular design with functions.
Feedback handling: Enhanced user experience with clear instructions and feedback messages.

Future Enhancements:
Difficulty Levels: Implementing multiple levels of difficulty.
Topic Expansion: Including a broader range of topics beyond general knowledge.
UI/UX Improvements: Enhancing the interface for better user engagement.
